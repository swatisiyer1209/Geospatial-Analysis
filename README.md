# Geospatial Analysis using GeoPandas

This repository consists of 2 mini proximity analysis projects. The projects were performed from as part of the mini course offered by Kaggle - "Geospatial Analysis"

# Project 1 - Analyzing Impact of Toxic gas release in Pennsylvania

This project investigates the proximity of air quality monitoring stations to toxic gas releasing plants in Pennsylvania. 

## Motivation
The results from the analysis can be used to improve and build more air quality monitoring stations around to city to ensure early detection of leaks and emissions, protect public health, and ensure compliance with air quality standards are maintained.

## Dataset
There are 2 datasets used for the analysis - Toxic gas releasing plants data and Air quality monitoring station dataset.

# Project 2 - Hospital Proximity Analysis

This project analyses how many hospitals are available to respond to crash collisions in New York city.

## Motivation
The results of the analysis can bolster improved emergency response planning through resource allocation, dispatch optimization and enhance public safety.

## Dataset
There are 2 datasets used for the analysis - collision dataset that consists of all the crash collision in New York city and the hospital dataset that consists of all the location and information of hospitals in the city.
